This software was developed based on the terms of the following NDA and IP agreements. 

Non-Disclosure Obligations
  COMPANY possesses and considers to be proprietary and confidential certain information, 
  drawings, data, software, documentation, business plans and know-how relating to technology 
  owned by COMPANY (all such confidential information, drawings, data, software, 
  documentation, business plans and know-how are hereinafter referred to as “CONFIDENTIAL 
  INFORMATION”). It is understood that STUDENT and COMPANY are both interested in having 
  STUDENT receive access to such CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION for the sole purpose of 
  working on PROJECT. Because such CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION is proprietary and 
  confidential to COMPANY, and to provide an appropriate basis by which such CONFIDENTIAL 
  INFORMATION can be made available to STUDENT, the parties agree to the following terms 
  and provisions:
    1. STUDENT will treat as confidential, and not disclose to any other person, all 
    CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION which is or has been made available, directly or indirectly, 
    to STUDENT, and will treat it with the same degree of care that it would treat 
    CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION of its own.
    2. STUDENT agrees to only use CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION for PROJECT and not for any 
    other purpose, whether commercial or non-commercial.
    3. STUDENT agrees not to make any copies of CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION unless 
    STUDENT has written permission from COMPANY.
    4. The non-disclosure obligations of STUDENT under this agreement do not apply to 
    CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION which: (a) at the time of the disclosure is generally 
    available to the public or thereafter becomes generally available to the public through no 
    act or omission of STUDENT; or (b) STUDENT can show by written records to have been in 
    STUDENT’s possession prior to the time of the disclosure and was not acquired, directly or 
    indirectly, from COMPANY. Furthermore, STUDENT may disclose Confidential Information 
    pursuant to an order of a court or governmental agency, provided that STUDENT first uses 
    reasonable efforts to provide COMPANY with advance notice to permit COMPANY to seek a 
    protective order or otherwise restrict the disclosure of the Confidential Information.
    5. STUDENT shall return all materials, drawings, data, memoranda, and written information in 
    STUDENT’s possession relating to such CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, including copies 
    thereof, to COMPANY, either upon request by COMPANY or at the completion of PROJECT.

    6. Nothing contained in this agreement shall be construed to grant to STUDENT any rights in 
    respect of such CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION other than for stated PROJECT.
    General Terms
    The parties agree that any xerographically or electronically reproduced copy of this fully-executed agreement shall have the same legal force and effect as any copy bearing original 
    signatures of the parties. This agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties 
    concerning the subject matter thereof.
    STUDENT understands they are not required to participate in PROJECT. 
    STUDENT acknowledges and agrees that all information, including CONFIDENTIAL 
    INFORMATION, transmitted by COMPANY is provided "AS IS" and without warranty, express, 
    implied or otherwise, regarding its use, results, accuracy or performance.
    This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of 
    Michigan, except that any Michigan’s choice-of-law provisions that would serve to apply the 
    law of a different state or country shall not apply. Any dispute under this Agreement not 
    otherwise resolved by the parties, shall be resolved by a court of competent jurisdiction in 
    Ingham County, Michigan, and the parties agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts.
    STUDENT’s obligations and responsibilities under this agreement will continue after 
    completion of PROJECT and/or conclusion of their involvement with PROJECT.
    
Assignment of Intellectual Property Rights
  STUDENT understands that they have contributed, or may be contributing, to the 
  development of PROJECT, including the creation of and making of works of authorship, 
  applications, code, inventions, creations, materials, papers, and/or discoveries made
  (conceived or first reduced to practice), and any and all other intellectual property, in the
  course of STUDENT’s work on PROJECT (hereafter “INVENTIONS”). STUDENT agrees as a 
  condition of participating in PROJECT, and in consideration for the benefits obtained by 
  working on PROJECT, to assign, and STUDENT hereby assigns, to COMPANY all rights, title, 
  and interest in any and all INVENTIONS.
  STUDENT acknowledges that by assigning rights in any and all INVENTIONS to COMPANY, 
  COMPANY will be the sole owner of INVENTIONS and will manage the rights in 
  INVENTIONS and be solely responsible for deciding what form of protection, if any, to 
  pursue and the form and extent of commercialization of INVENTIONS, if any.

Cooperation with COMPANY
  STUDENT agrees to inform COMPANY of all INVENTIONS and to reasonably cooperate with 
  COMPANY, at COMPANY’s expense, to secure COMPANY’s rights in the intellectual property 
  (including copyright(s), patent(s), trademark(s), trade secret(s), or other means of 
  protecting inventions) related to INVENTIONS.

  Agreement not otherwise resolved by the parties, shall be resolved by a court of competent
